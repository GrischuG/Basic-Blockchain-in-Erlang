# Basic-Blockchain-in-Erlang

This project was part of our fifth-semester course in the Computer Science BSc course at the Univerité de Fribourg. 
A detailed description of the implementation can be found in the report.

# How to Run

## Requirements
You need the files project.erl, color.erl and color.hrl and compile the erl files using erlang.
For the program to run, you need to start it in two terminals. The program does not run until it connects to the second instance. 

## Commands
### Compilation of Source Code
First, compile the project.erl and color.erl file in an Erlang shell with `c(project)`. & `c(color)` .

### Command for the Terminal

`erl -sname \#\{name@host\} -setcookie \#\{secret\} -s project start \#\{cli\} \#\{otherName@otherHost\} \#\{NumberofProcesses\}`

- `\#\{name@host\}` is the sname and hostname of the local erlang VM
- `\#\{secret\}` is the shared secret
- `\#\{cli\}` true for running in interactive (CLI) mode, false for seeing the automated 'back-end'
- `\#\{otherName@otherHost\}` is the sname and hostname of the remote (other) erlang node
- `\#\{NumberofProcesses\}` is the \# of processes that will mine new blocks, more -> the blockchain grows faster and the likelihood of forks increases

### Examples 
- `erl -sname foo@localhost -setcookie test -s project start true bar@localhost 3`
- `erl -sname bar@localhost -setcookie test -s project start false foo@localhost 60`

## IMPOPRTANT
The user interface currently only runs properly on windows systems.
